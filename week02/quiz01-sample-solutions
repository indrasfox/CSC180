1. A single byte is made of 8 bits. So how many values can be represented by a single Byte?
Answer: 256 (hint: 2^8=256)


2. Which type of error results in the C# compiler not compiling the code? (Select one: Logical, Syntax, Runtime)
Answer: Syntax error


3. Show the full path of the executable file of your "Hello world" program on your own computer.
Answer: on my own computer, the full path is: "C:\Users\GL\source\repos\CSC205Week02\CSC205Week02\"


4. Debugging exercise
// all bugs have been removed
using System;
namespace CSC180Quiz01
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("I just removed all the bugs!")
        }
    }
}


5. Select all the invalid C# identifiers and briefly explain why.
     String, my-age, 3rdNum, dynamic, __num, M&M, @void, var
Answers:
  Invalid:
    my-age: dash is not allowed
    3rdNum: starts with a number
    M&M: special character & is not allowed
  Valid:
    String: avoid it because it is similar to string
    __num: two leading underscores are okay but try to avoid this type of identifiers. The ANSI C standard allows 
      identifier names that begin with these character combinations to be reserved for compiler use.
    @void: 
      You can declare identifiers that match C# keywords by using the @ prefix on the identifier. 
      The @ is not part of the identifier name. For example, @if declares an identifier named if. 
      These verbatim identifiers are primarily for interoperability with identifiers declared in other languages.

    var & dynamic are Contextual Keywords. you can use them to name variables like: int var = 5; but try to avoid them.

6. What does the following code snippet accomplish? What role does variable z play? Briefly explain the algorithm.
	int x=3, y=5, z;
	z = x; x = y; y = z;
Answer: The above code snippet effectively swaps the values of x and y using a third variable z


7. What does the following code snippet do (or what happen to x and y after the two assignment statements? Briefly explain the algorithm.
	double x = 3.2, y = 5.8;
	x = x + y;
	y = x - y;
	x = x - y;
Answer: The above code snippet effectively swaps the values of x and y WITHOUT using a third variable
